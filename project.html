            <h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Description:</h3>
            <p>
                The Portfolio Website project was an extensive undertaking to establish a robust online presence that not only showcases my technical expertise but also serves as a professional platform for clients and employers to learn about me. The project involved creating a responsive and aesthetically pleasing website that highlights my skills, work, and achievements while maintaining ease of navigation and interactivity.
                <br><br>
                **Key Technologies Used:**
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> <b>HTML5:</b> The foundation for semantic and accessible web pages.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> <b>CSS3:</b> Used for styling with Flexbox, Grid, and advanced animations.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> <b>JavaScript:</b> Enabled interactivity like modal pop-ups, smooth scrolling, and dynamic content rendering.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> <b>Bootstrap:</b> For responsive design and pre-styled components.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> <b>Font Awesome:</b> Added icons to enhance visual appeal.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3><i class="fa fa-tools"></i> Struggles:</h3>
            <p>
                Building this portfolio presented a variety of challenges that pushed my problem-solving skills to the limit. One of the most significant hurdles was achieving a seamless responsive design across different screen sizes and devices. Complex layouts like the Portfolio section required a deep understanding of CSS Grid and media queries, and fine-tuning for various resolutions.
                Performance optimization also required extensive research and implementation. To ensure fast loading times, I employed image compression, lazy loading for offscreen content, and minification of CSS and JavaScript files. Debugging cross-browser compatibility issues was another time-intensive task, particularly when testing in older versions of Safari and Internet Explorer.
                Accessibility was another challenge that required a significant investment of time. Adding meaningful ARIA roles, ensuring sufficient contrast for all text elements, and enabling smooth keyboard navigation were all essential to making the website accessible to a wider audience.
            </p>

            <h3><i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> Completion:</h3>
            <p>
                After weeks of dedicated work, the portfolio was successfully launched and received positive feedback from colleagues, mentors, and potential employers. The project became a strong representation of my abilities in both frontend and backend development, as well as my commitment to delivering high-quality, user-centric designs.
                **Significant Achievements Include:**
